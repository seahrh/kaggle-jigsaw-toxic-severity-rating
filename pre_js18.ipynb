We know (or at least I know) Daffy Duck is NOT a real person, Plucky Duck is NOT a real person, they have NO fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers. So because Plucky Duck is NOT a real person, Plucky (just like every single other cartoon character that says he/she/it does) can't be signed to a contract. However when he implies he can, he implies it that he has signed this contract in the \"\"real life\"\" we keep trying to tell you about. And it is in this \"\"real life\"\" where Plucky is Daffy's REAL father, while the one in the baby Plucky cartoon is just an \"\"actor\"\" (hired in the \"\"real world\"\" where this cartoon character \"\"signed a contract\"\") \"\"playing\"\" his father. \"   \n",

       "129350  \" You're ignoring this \"\"real life\"\" fact we keep trying to tell you about. We know (or at least I know) Daffy Duck is NOT a real person, Plucky Duck is NOT a real person, they have NO fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers. So because Plucky Duck is NOT a real person, Plucky (just like every single other cartoon character that says he/she/it does) can't be signed to a contract. However when he implies he can, he implies it that he has signed this contract in the \"\"real life\"\" we keep trying to tell you about. And it is in this \"\"real life\"\" where Plucky is Daffy's REAL father, while the one in the baby Plucky cartoon is just an \"\"actor\"\" (hired in the \"\"real world\"\" where this cartoon character \"\"signed a contract\"\") \"\"playing\"\" his father. \"   \n",

       "210773  \" \\n\\n While the first sentence of the second paragraph of the 'Response to Critique' is indeed an apposite and effective response to the critique of theistic evolution, the second and third sentences of that paragraph (\"\"It is also tempered by a limited predictive value of the evolutionary theory. To paraphrase Popper, evolution tells us 'everything about the past but nothing about the future.'\"\") relate to evolution itself, not to theistic evolution, and certainly not to the preceding critique of theistic evolution. (Bear in mind that this 'Response' is made from the standpoint of a proponent of theistic evolution.) \\n\\n I propose to remove those two sentences as being irrelevant and diluting the force of the preceding response.

       "210773  \" While the first sentence of the second paragraph of the 'Response to Critique' is indeed an apposite and effective response to the critique of theistic evolution, the second and third sentences of that paragraph (\"\"It is also tempered by a limited predictive value of the evolutionary theory. To paraphrase Popper, evolution tells us 'everything about the past but nothing about the future.'\"\") relate to evolution itself, not to theistic evolution, and certainly not to the preceding critique of theistic evolution. (Bear in mind that this 'Response' is made from the standpoint of a proponent of theistic evolution.) I propose to remove those two sentences as being irrelevant and diluting the force of the preceding response. Any comments? ~ \"   \n",
