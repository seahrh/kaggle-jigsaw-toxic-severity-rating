       "387   Well, this gets right into a fundamental question of philosophy:  Where do morals come from?  The historical answer, the one that -most-, but not all, Atheists refuse to acknowledge, is religion.  Western society is built from that pre-supposition.  Our founding fathers certainly didn't have better solutions.\\n\\nWell, without morals, life is just a cruel game of thrones and power, about who can squeeze the most out of it before someone else backstabs them.  There's might still be moral people in such societies, but they usually end up with their heads on pikes to be shown off to their own daughters.\\n\\nSo where do morals come from?\\n\\nWell.  The easy answer is still religion, and it seems to be the only answer that has any sort of popularity.  \n",

Agreed.\\n\\nBut it also depends on your culture. The norm in some cultures require the guest to first refuse several times before finally giving in and accepting. The host is expected to continue to offer and attempt to convince the guest until they accept. The guest in these situations often wants to drink, but must be polite and first refuse. This is especially true if the guest is a woman. It would be seen as rude or stingy for the host not to ask the guest several times if they would want a drink.\\n\\nSo what you see as pestering is, for the host, a social/cultural obligation.  \n",

It is not “fair to call him a child. Young adult at worst. He knew that his actions had consequences. He hid in the herd and then went for snacks. That is calculating and cold blooded. He did not want to get caught and he had a plan. That is not the actions of a “child”. And by pushing that narrative you are simply proving that you are blinded by your opinion.   \n",
