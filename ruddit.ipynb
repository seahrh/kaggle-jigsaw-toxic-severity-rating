If they were looking for fame, they would be more likely to choose a big soft target at random, somewhere with really no connection to them.</td>\n",

The healthcare industry is bloated because it takes a lot of manpower to comply with all the regulation. it is hard to argue that there is unchecked capitalism in education when state governments have a near-monopoly in elementary and secondary education, and the federal government is very involved in higher education. More regulation will result in lower quality or higher cost to compensate for the burden of regulatory compliance. Often you will end up with lower quality and higher cost.

Motives seem to be divided among revenge/anger, start-a-revolution-against-govt, start-a-race/religious-war, and incoherent/unknown. Probably the most common motive is anger/revenge. that is why most shooters choose a target relevant to them: their school, their workplace, their house, a church used by the race they hate, a nightclub they went to. If they were looking for fame, they would be more likely to choose a big soft target at random, somewhere with really no connection to them.  \n",
