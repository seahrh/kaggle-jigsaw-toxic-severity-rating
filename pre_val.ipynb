       "11332  Max, I seriously don't give a flying fuck about you, Jakezing, or your attitudes towards each other. What's done is done. What you need to do now is move on. Forget about Jake. You'll probably never see him again on Wikipedia. You've spoiled your otherwise-clean record dealing with that pompous jackass, and you don't need to do any more damage to it. So he didn't tell you why he had a problem with you. Quite frankly, I can't understand why either of you kept arguing with the other for so long. I believe that's just poor judgment, really. In any case, I don't have to help you with anything, nor will I. The only reason I stepped into this was because I was trying to stop you two from ripping each others' throats out, and that didn't do any good, since you two just kept right on. He might have confused you with someone else, but that was no reason for you to keep harassing him about it. You and him both have displayed abuse of WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA on countless occasions. Now, please, do us all a favor and go on your way. ()(talk)(evidence)    \n",

       "11332  Max, I seriously don't give a flying fuck about you, Jakezing, or your attitudes towards each other. What's done is done. What you need to do now is move on. Forget about Jake. You'll probably never see him again on Wikipedia. You've spoiled your otherwise-clean record dealing with that pompous jackass, and you don't need to do any more damage to it. So he didn't tell you why he had a problem with you. Quite frankly, I can't understand why either of you kept arguing with the other for so long. I believe that's just poor judgment, really. In any case, I don't have to help you with anything, nor will I. The only reason I stepped into this was because I was trying to stop you two from ripping each others' throats out, and that didn't do any good, since you two just kept right on. He might have confused you with someone else, but that was no reason for you to keep harassing him about it. You and him both have displayed abuse of WP (CIVIL and WP) NPA on countless occasions.

       "11332  Max, I seriously do not give a flying fuck about you, Jakezing, or your attitudes towards each other. what is done is done. What you need to do now is move on. Forget about Jake. you will probably never see him again on Wikipedia. you have spoiled your otherwise-clean record dealing with that pompous jackass, and you do not need to do any more damage to it. So he did not tell you why he had a problem with you. Quite frankly, I cannot understand why either of you kept arguing with the other for so long. I believe that is just poor judgment, really. In any case, I do not have to help you with anything, nor will I. The only reason I stepped into this was because I was trying to stop you two from ripping each others' throats out, and that did not do any good, since you two just kept right on. He might have confused you with someone else, but that was no reason for you to keep harassing him about it. You and him both have displayed abuse of WP (CIVIL and WP) NPA on countless occasions.

I said that the fact is irrelevant to anal sex, and the way it is presented in the article leads to a colorful and inaccurate interpretation of male-male anal sex. It is not the most straight-forward way to explain pleasure from male receptive anal sexit is factually and logically a roundabout way to do it, and it is misleading. Really, that's what the issue is. As I have several times mentioned, the only thing that is relevant to anal sex is that prostate stimulation can be pleasureable; it's homology with the Skene's gland is completely irrelevant. Also, do you think that the psychological factor plays no role in receptive pleasure? I personally think that it plays a larger role than the prostate does, but it isn't mentioned once in the article.     \n",

       "5175   Falcon, you can run and hide but you will never have the balls that God handed to Mark Slater, and maybe only a tiny fraction of the brains.  I don't know what you look like but I suppose that if you only have two eyes, a nose, and mouth, compared to Slater, you may be ahead of the game in the looks department.  BUT...he obviously doesn't care about looks, since he's got the balls and brains of an enlightened warrior, something you will never have.  You only wish I were a troll, so that you can demonize me, and consign me to a lower level of species, like some revolting gargoyle hanging off a church.   I am not a troll, I am a defender of Truth, and yes, I read your parody of Truth written by some jealous Wiki editor, but there are absolutes in this Universe, Falcon, and the one absolute you cannot argue against is that Coldplay is the ultimate in trite mediocrity, while most unsigned musicians are far far far superior in musical talent.  That is a piece of Truth you cannot accept, it is too politically incorrect, and instead, you will place tags on good listings, and revoke smart edits.  Do not construe this as a personal attack, since I do not address your religion, politics, or ambiguous sexual orientation.\\n     \n",

I said that the fact is irrelevant to anal sex, and the way it is presented in the article leads to a colorful and inaccurate interpretation of male-male anal sex. It is not the most straight-forward way to explain pleasure from male receptive anal sexit is factually and logically a roundabout way to do it, and it is misleading. Really, that's what the issue is. As I have several times mentioned, the only thing that is relevant to anal sex is that prostate stimulation can be pleasureable; it's homology with the Skene's gland is completely irrelevant. Also, do you think that the psychological factor plays no role in receptive pleasure? I personally think that it plays a larger role than the prostate does, but it isn't mentioned once in the article.   \n",

       "5175   Falcon, you can run and hide but you will never have the balls that God handed to Mark Slater, and maybe only a tiny fraction of the brains. I don't know what you look like but I suppose that if you only have two eyes, a nose, and mouth, compared to Slater, you may be ahead of the game in the looks department. BUT...he obviously doesn't care about looks, since he's got the balls and brains of an enlightened warrior, something you will never have. You only wish I were a troll, so that you can demonize me, and consign me to a lower level of species, like some revolting gargoyle hanging off a church. I am not a troll, I am a defender of Truth, and yes, I read your parody of Truth written by some jealous Wiki editor, but there are absolutes in this Universe, Falcon, and the one absolute you cannot argue against is that Coldplay is the ultimate in trite mediocrity, while most unsigned musicians are far far far superior in musical talent. That is a piece of Truth you cannot accept, it is too politically incorrect, and instead, you will place tags on good listings, and revoke smart edits. Do not construe this as a personal attack, since I do not address your religion, politics, or ambiguous sexual orientation.   \n",

I said that the fact is irrelevant to anal sex, and the way it is presented in the article leads to a colorful and inaccurate interpretation of male-male anal sex. It is not the most straight-forward way to explain pleasure from male receptive anal [to make a hasty exit while in the act of sexual intercourse] is factually and logically a roundabout way to do it, and it is misleading. Really, that is what the issue is. As I have several times mentioned, the only thing that is relevant to anal sex is that prostate stimulation can be pleasureable; it is homology with the Skene's gland is completely irrelevant. Also, do you think that the psychological factor plays no role in receptive pleasure? I personally think that it plays a larger role than the prostate does, but it is not mentioned once in the article.  \n",

       "5175   Falcon, you can run and hide but you will never have the balls that God handed to Mark Slater, and maybe only a tiny fraction of the brains. I do not know what you look like but I suppose that if you only have two eyes, a nose, and mouth, compared to Slater, you may be ahead of the game in the looks department. BUT...he obviously does not care about looks, since he is got the balls and brains of an enlightened warrior, something you will never have. You only wish I were a troll, so that you can demonize me, and consign me to a lower level of species, like some revolting gargoyle hanging off a church. I am not a troll, I am a defender of Truth, and yes, I read your parody of Truth written by some jealous [a website or database developed collaboratively by an online community] editor, but there are absolutes in this Universe, Falcon, and the one absolute you cannot argue against is that Coldplay is the ultimate in trite mediocrity, while most unsigned musicians are far far far superior in musical talent. That is a piece of Truth you cannot accept, it is too politically incorrect, and instead, you will place tags on good listings, and revoke smart edits. Do not construe this as a personal attack, since I do not address your religion, politics, or ambiguous sexual orientation.  \n",

What's taking you so long.

I'm suggesting no change beyond that, but I feel I have provided the beginning of sufficient evidence to support the necessity of this change. \"   \n",

       "5582   \":: Wow, you are an idiot. here is my imitation of Tao (include immature mocking tone): \"\"I think I know things. I think I can get people blocked. I think I know rules. Provide evidence you guys. Oh know there is some evidence, my bwain hurts, my bwain hurts, I forgot how to read, waaaaaaaah.\"\" It is a proposal you fucking idiot. It shows you are wrong. You refusing to read it does not make you right. It just makes you stupid. You call it \"\"undergraduate\"\" as if it lacks validity when you refuse to read it which makes you not only and idiot, but a stubborn baseless idiot. Block me, bitch, I fucking beg you. what is taking you so long. Practical proposal for change based on evidence provided above Simple to read for assholes who refuse to read (Proposals) 1) change phrasing in intro 2) do not change focus of the majority of the page on the \"\"close circle\"\" 3) perhaps make \"\"writers\"\" section more reader friendly for casual readers with a chart, or something quick and simple to read 4) change naming of \"\"writers\"\" section to something reflected broader scope 5) I would like something like 3 & 4 to be closer to the top, but I do recognize Doom's concern that it weighs down the intro, so we can see for now if it works. I am suggesting no change beyond that, but I feel I have provided the beginning of sufficient evidence to support the necessity of this change. \"  "
