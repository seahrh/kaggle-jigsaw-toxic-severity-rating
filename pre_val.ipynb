       "13584   the truth \\n\\nPLease explain to me, sentence by sentence, why you have edited out the following addition:\\n\\nThe main impact zone of the crash was approximately 19 metres (57 feet) in width. No wreckage was found from the airliner within this impact zone or inside the building. The lawn immediately in front of the crash site was unmarked. Within the main impact zone was a hole that the object punched in the building, approximately 9 metres (27 feet) in width. The Pentagon is composed of five concentric rings. Only the outer three rings were penetrated. The upper floors of the first ring collapsed, but the structural integrity of the second and third rings remained. At the end of the third ring was a circular 'punch out' hole, again 9 metres (27 feet) in diameter. The wingspan of a Boeing 757 is 38 metres (114 feet). The vast majority of the mass of the aircraft remains unnaccounted for. For flight 77 to have caused the damage observed at the Pentagon, the wings would have had to have been broken off, pushed into the fuselage, after which the fueselage and wings would have had to have been compressed sufficiently to fit through the 9 metre hole. No physical mechanism by which this process could have occurred is known.\\n\\nFlight 77 did not hit the pentagon. Its so obvious as to be comical. The capacity of human beings to believe what is demonstrably complete bullshit because they are afraid of going against the group consensus never ceases to amaze me. You are being lied to, day in, day out, by your media. Stop. Think. Please.\\n\\nIn America everybody is of the opinion that he has no social superiors, since all men are equal, but he does not admit that he has no social inferiors, for, from the time of Jefferson onward, the doctrine that all men are equal applies only upwards, not downwards. \\nBertrand Russell\\n    \n",

       "13584  the truth PLease explain to me, sentence by sentence, why you have edited out the following addition: The main impact zone of the crash was approximately 19 metres (57 feet) in width. No wreckage was found from the airliner within this impact zone or inside the building. The lawn immediately in front of the crash site was unmarked. Within the main impact zone was a hole that the object punched in the building, approximately 9 metres (27 feet) in width. The Pentagon is composed of five concentric rings. Only the outer three rings were penetrated. The upper floors of the first ring collapsed, but the structural integrity of the second and third rings remained. At the end of the third ring was a circular 'punch out' hole, again 9 metres (27 feet) in diameter. The wingspan of a Boeing 757 is 38 metres (114 feet). The vast majority of the mass of the aircraft remains unnaccounted for. For flight 77 to have caused the damage observed at the Pentagon, the wings would have had to have been broken off, pushed into the fuselage, after which the fueselage and wings would have had to have been compressed sufficiently to fit through the 9 metre hole. No physical mechanism by which this process could have occurred is known. Flight 77 did not hit the pentagon. Its so obvious as to be comical. The capacity of human beings to believe what is demonstrably complete bullshit because they are afraid of going against the group consensus never ceases to amaze me. You are being lied to, day in, day out, by your media. Stop. Think. Please. In America everybody is of the opinion that he has no social superiors, since all men are equal, but he does not admit that he has no social inferiors, for, from the time of Jefferson onward, the doctrine that all men are equal applies only upwards, not downwards.

       "13584  the truth PLease explain to me, sentence by sentence, why you have edited out the following addition: The main impact zone of the crash was approximately 19 metres (57 feet) in width. No wreckage was found from the airliner within this impact zone or inside the building. The lawn immediately in front of the crash site was unmarked. Within the main impact zone was a hole that the object punched in the building, approximately 9 metres (27 feet) in width. The Pentagon is composed of five concentric rings. Only the outer three rings were penetrated. The upper floors of the first ring collapsed, but the structural integrity of the second and third rings remained. At the end of the third ring was a circular 'punch out' hole, again 9 metres (27 feet) in diameter. The wingspan of a Boeing 757 is 38 metres (114 feet). The vast majority of the mass of the aircraft remains unnaccounted for. For flight 77 to have caused the damage observed at the Pentagon, the wings would have had to have been broken off, pushed into the fuselage, after which the fueselage and wings would have had to have been compressed sufficiently to fit through the 9 metre hole. No physical mechanism by which this process could have occurred is known. Flight 77 did not hit the pentagon. Its so obvious as to be comical. The capacity of human beings to believe what is demonstrably complete bullshit because they are afraid of going against the group consensus never ceases to amaze me. You are being lied to, day in, day out, by your media. Stop. Think. Please. In America everybody is of the opinion that he has no social superiors, since all men are equal, but he does not admit that he has no social inferiors, for, from the time of Jefferson onward, the doctrine that all men are equal applies only upwards, not downwards.

I edited the first line of the paragraph to read \"\"Christaphobic Bash Back! members disrupted... &amp; added the following footnote \"\"Christphobia (from Greek Christos: Messiah; phobos: fear, phobia) is an irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against Christianity.\"\" I took the defanition word for wors from Wakopedia's definition for Homophobia &amp; just changed the [slur for homosexuals]/Christos &amp; [slur for homosexuals]/ Christian parts.

I don't know whether German prosecutors are this unreasonable, but I know in the U.S. they have actually prosecuted children for making \"\"child pornography\"\" of themselves ... if the comment actually is illegal to make there, I'm not sure it is safe even for a victim to keep reposting it.  But Wikipedia itself should not be eager to gather up censorship laws from around the world.\\nIt's too hard for me to puzzle through all the German text relevant to this case (which Google Translate handles far more poorly than Chinese or Arabic, alas).  But I think as we're seeing in the present Fae ArbCom case, there's a huge divide in perceptions of bias between those who are members of an ethnic group, and those who are outside of it.  Is it anti-gay to say that marriage should be between one man and one woman, or anti-Semitic to say that the U.S. should end all foreign aid to Israel?  Or to keep a street named after a historical figure with a notable animosity to either group?  Your answer depends on who you are.  If we are to continue to have one Wikipedia for every nation and background, we'll have to be willing to accommodate that terms like \"\"homophobic\"\" and \"\"anti-Semitic\"\" mean very different things to very different people, and not punish anyone for using them the way they personally perceive them.   \"   \n",

I don't know whether German prosecutors are this unreasonable, but I know in the U.S. they have actually prosecuted children for making \"\"child pornography\"\" of themselves ... if the comment actually is illegal to make there, I'm not sure it is safe even for a victim to keep reposting it. But Wikipedia itself should not be eager to gather up censorship laws from around the world. It's too hard for me to puzzle through all the German text relevant to this case (which Google Translate handles far more poorly than Chinese or Arabic, alas). But I think as we're seeing in the present Fae ArbCom case, there's a huge divide in perceptions of bias between those who are members of an ethnic group, and those who are outside of it. Is it anti-gay to say that marriage should be between one man and one woman, or anti-Semitic to say that the U.S. should end all foreign aid to Israel? Or to keep a street named after a historical figure with a notable animosity to either group? Your answer depends on who you are. If we are to continue to have one Wikipedia for every nation and background, we'll have to be willing to accommodate that terms like \"\"homophobic\"\" and \"\"anti-Semitic\"\" mean very different things to very different people, and not punish anyone for using them the way they personally perceive them. \"   \n",

       "1787   \" wikipedia's censorship I looked up Bash Back (The sodomite terrorist group that attacked the Church in Michigan) on wikipedia (just to see what liberal bias they would have. Under the section \"\"Antifascist action at 2008 Milwaukee Pridefest\"\" Wakopedia says \"\"In response, Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group.\"\" the \"\"hate group they are talking about is the NAZIs but then if the NAZIs are a hate group then Bash back must also be a hate group so I edited it to say \"\"In response, The hate group Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group.\"\" Since they also didn't have any topic for the new terrorist attack on the church I added a few lines & was attacked by the Admins. So they added the following paragraph 2008 Disruption at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, MI Bash Back! members disrupted a Sunday sermon at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, Michigan on November 9th, 2008. They dropped a banner in the church, threw thousands of fliers, made out in front of the congregation, yelled \"\"Jesus was a Homo\",\" pulled the fire alarm and initiated pro-gay chants. Mt. Hope is an Assemblies of God church which holds and promotes \"\"ex-gay\"\" events and preaches that homosexuality is a sin. I edited the first line of the paragraph to read \"\"Christaphobic Bash Back! members disrupted.... & added the following footnote \"\"Christphobia (from Greek Christos: Messiah; phobos: fear, phobia) is an irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against Christianity.\"\" I took the defanition word for wors from Wakopedia's definition for Homophobia & just changed the Homo/Christos & Homo/ Christian parts. For this I received the following note from the admin This is the last warning you will receive for your disruptive edits, such as those you made to Bash Back. If you vandalize Wikipedia again, you will be blocked from editing. Please maintain a neutral point of view. ukexpat (talk) Funny how liberals love to censor everyone & then call us evil\"   \n",

It seems that there is a hierarchy at Wikipedia that just shows the high level of discrimination us ordinary users have to put up with.

I do not know whether German prosecutors are this unreasonable, but I know in the U.S. they have actually prosecuted children for making \"\"child pornography\"\" of themselves ... if the comment actually is illegal to make there, I am not sure it is safe even for a victim to keep reposting it. But Wikipedia itself should not be eager to gather up censorship laws from around the world. it is too hard for me to puzzle through all the German text relevant to this case (which Google Translate handles far more poorly than Chinese or Arabic, alas). But I think as we are seeing in the present Fae ArbCom case, there is a huge divide in perceptions of bias between those who are members of an ethnic group, and those who are outside of it. Is it anti-gay to say that marriage should between one man and one woman, or anti-Semitic to say that the U.S. should end all foreign aid to Israel? Or to keep a street named after a historical figure with a notable animosity to either group? Your answer depends on who you are. If we are to continue to have one Wikipedia for every nation and background, we will have to be willing to accommodate that terms like \"\"homophobic\"\" and \"\"anti-Semitic\"\" mean very different things to very different people, and not punish anyone for using them the way they personally perceive them. \"   \n",

       "1787   \" wikipedia's censorship I looked up Bash Back (The sodomite terrorist group that attacked the Church in Michigan) on wikipedia (just to see what liberal bias they would have. Under the section \"\"Antifascist action at 2008 Milwaukee Pridefest\"\" Wakopedia says \"\"In response, Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group.\"\" the \"\"hate group they are talking about is the NAZIs but then if the NAZIs are a hate group then Bash back must also be a hate group so I edited it to say \"\"In response, The hate group Bash Back! Milwaukee planned a confrontation of the hate group.\"\" Since they also did not have any topic for the new terrorist attack on the church I added a few lines & was attacked by the Admins. So they added the following paragraph 2008 Disruption at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, MI Bash Back! members disrupted a Sunday sermon at Mt. Hope Church in Lansing, Michigan on November 9th, 2008. They dropped a banner in the church, threw thousands of fliers, made out in front of the congregation, yelled \"\"Jesus was a [slur for homosexuals]\",\" pulled the fire alarm and initiated pro-gay chants. Mt. Hope is an Assemblies of God church which holds and promotes \"\"ex-gay\"\" events and preaches that homosexuality is a sin. I edited the first line of the paragraph to read \"\"Christaphobic Bash Back! members disrupted... & added the following footnote \"\"Christphobia (from Greek Christos: Messiah; phobos: fear, phobia) is an irrational fear of, aversion to, or discrimination against Christianity.\"\" I took the defanition word for wors from Wakopedia's definition for Homophobia & just changed the [slur for homosexuals]/Christos & [slur for homosexuals]/ Christian parts. For this I received the following note from the admin This the last warning you will receive for your disruptive edits, such as those you made to Bash Back. If you vandalize Wikipedia again, you will be blocked from editing. Please maintain a neutral point of view. ukexpat (talk) Funny how liberals love to censor everyone & then call us evil\"   \n",

It seems that there is a hierarchy at Wikipedia that just shows the high level of discrimination us ordinary users have to put up with.
