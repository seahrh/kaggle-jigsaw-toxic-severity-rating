I tried appealing to wafulz who seemed to not understand or care about what was going on. I think for the most part he is the overseer of the page. I am sorry if I barked at you. I have been blindsided by ignorant people here from the beginning. I am interested in the 'truth' of this as you seem to be. You are probably right about getting someones attention about Technocrate. He did these same exact reverts when I first arrived then disappeared for a while. He has never creatively done any thing.\\n Would you mind doing it, blowing the whistle,  or bringing it to the attention of wafulz, or better yet a different editor admin. I would appreciate that. He does not seem disposed toward me. I have tried many times to engage him.   \n",
       "6412    I am very surprised and have to say that I think such action is both unnecessary and is being ridiculous. Having just read the complaint, I think it's very extreme to start calling me a meatpuppet. This is totally contrary to your other welcome messages earlier. I think you have some serious issues and trying to reignite and fan the flames isn't going to help. I can keep LK under control to get this article finished, but you do seem to have a very worrying issue about one small matter that he wanted included. Considering the amount of trouble that I have now gone to, to help settle this article, it would appear that you are now just absolutely intent on trying to score personal points against him. That does not give anyone a good opinion as to your real intentions here. Is there another agenda here? It seems that despite Alf's comments and other offers to resolve the actual problem, you seem intent on going behind our backs anyway to stir up a full scale war. Very disapponted.     \n",

I have been blindsided by ignorant people here from the beginning. I am interested in the 'truth' of this as you seem to be. You are probably right about getting someones attention about Technocrate. He did these same exact reverts when I first arrived then disappeared for a while. He has never creatively done any thing. Would you mind doing it, blowing the whistle, or bringing it to the attention of wafulz, or better yet a different editor admin. I would appreciate that. He does not seem disposed toward me.

       "6412   I am very surprised and have to say that I think such action is both unnecessary and is being ridiculous. Having just read the complaint, I think it's very extreme to start calling me a meatpuppet. This is totally contrary to your other welcome messages earlier. I think you have some serious issues and trying to reignite and fan the flames isn't going to help. I can keep LK under control to get this article finished, but you do seem to have a very worrying issue about one small matter that he wanted included. Considering the amount of trouble that I have now gone to, to help settle this article, it would appear that you are now just absolutely intent on trying to score personal points against him. That does not give anyone a good opinion as to your real intentions here. Is there another agenda here? It seems that despite Alf's comments and other offers to resolve the actual problem, you seem intent on going behind our backs anyway to stir up a full scale war. Very disapponted.   \n",

I have been blindsided by ignorant people here from the beginning. I am interested in the 'truth' of this as you seem to be. You are probably right about getting someones attention about Technocrate. He did these same exact reverts when I first arrived then disappeared for a while. He has never creatively done any thing. Would you mind doing it, blowing the whistle, or bring it to the attention of wafulz, or better yet a different editor admin. I would appreciate that. He does not seem disposed toward me.

       "6412   I am very surprised and have to say that I think such action is both unnecessary and is being ridiculous. Having just read the complaint, I think it is very extreme to start calling me a meatpuppet. This totally contrary to your other welcome messages earlier. I think you have some serious issues and trying to reignite and fan the flames is not going to help. I can keep LK under control to get this article finished, but you do seem to have a very worrying issue about one small matter that he wanted included. Considering the amount of trouble that I have now gone to, to help settle this article, it would appear that you are now just absolutely intent on trying to score personal points against him. That does not give anyone a good opinion as to your real intentions here. Is there another agenda here? It seems that despite Alf's comments and other offers to resolve the actual problem, you seem intent on going behind our backs anyway to stir up a full scale war. Very disapponted.   \n",

Do you know that all of yugoslavia cried when tito croaked ? Haha. it is great that you have noticed that no, in fact, tito is nobody and nothing but a DEMocidal totalitarian communist dictator. Top it off he was a locksmith by trade probably learned to read shortly after the war. He was a a puppet in regards to geopolitical relations between the east and west during the cold war years - his legacy and his psychopathic bloodthirsty trail ended with his sick national experiment which will never return ever.

Tito wasn't important ?! How could you say such a thing?? Do you know how many important people came to his funeral! Do you know that all of yugoslavia cried when tito croaked ? Hahahaha. It's great that you've noticed that no, in fact, tito is nobody and nothing but a DEMocidal totalitarian communist dictator. To top it off he was a locksmith by trade probably learned to read shortly after the war. He was a a puppet in regards to geopolitical relations between the east and west during the cold war years - his legacy and his psychopathic bloodthirsty trail ended with his sick national experiment which will never ever ever ever return ever. In the end, if people DID care - they would realize that this entire article which DIREKTOR has a WN:OWN on is a disgrace to the western world, freedom and democracy.      \n",

As I said elsewhere, wikipedia has gotten a very bad reputation so just such whimsical reverting as the two idiots were constantly doing. \\n\\nAnd going by the things I've read about all of you, no doubt you'll now block me from posting even on my own page. \\n\\nEither re-instate me or block the two idiots as well.

They make wikipedia a better place, regardless of source (and for the record I think that ALL of my images qualify as fair use). You're actually working against everything that is good about wikipedia, systematically going after people and questioning everything they do. Who told you to do this? Why take the 'law' into your own hands? Ask yourself this: who are you protecting? You wanna play cops and robbers, go and joing the freaking police. Do something useful, rather than wasting your life on here. What is your job? Cos this ain't real life buddy, and if its your only hobby, I feel bad for you. I mean really bad. I thinks it's quite sad that your only reason for using wikipedia is to actively reverse what other people do, rather than to actively create content. I will review all the images you 'helpfully' tagged for me, but I'm getting real tired of you ducking me man. Peace out.     \n",

Incidentally, like with so many other things Jewish - The Israeli national anthem isn't \"\"Jewish\"\" at all, but an old Italian song, if I'm not mistaken, with Hebrew lyrics. Btw, Hebrew is an artificially revived language. Up until last century it was like Latin - a dead language, used only in religion (which needs to die too). And then it was artificially resuscitated by Zionists. Which is funny, because the founders of teh modern state of Israel were atheists, it's a shame what they have done, giving a bad name to all atheists.   \"   \n",

Tito wasn't important ?! How could you say such a thing?? Do you know how many important people came to his funeral! Do you know that all of yugoslavia cried when tito croaked ? Hahahaha. It's great that you've noticed that no, in fact, tito is nobody and nothing but a DEMocidal totalitarian communist dictator. To top it off he was a locksmith by trade probably learned to read shortly after the war. He was a a puppet in regards to geopolitical relations between the east and west during the cold war years - his legacy and his psychopathic bloodthirsty trail ended with his sick national experiment which will never ever ever ever return ever. In the end, if people DID care - they would realize that this entire article which DIREKTOR has a WN:OWN on is a disgrace to the western world, freedom and democracy.   \n",

They make wikipedia a better place, regardless of source (and for the record I think that ALL of my images qualify as fair use). You're actually working against everything that is good about wikipedia, systematically going after people and questioning everything they do. Who told you to do this? Why take the 'law' into your own hands? Ask yourself this: who are you protecting? You wanna play cops and robbers, go and joing the freaking police. Do something useful, rather than wasting your life on here. What is your job? Cos this ain't real life buddy, and if its your only hobby, I feel bad for you. I mean really bad. I thinks it's quite sad that your only reason for using wikipedia is to actively reverse what other people do, rather than to actively create content. I will review all the images you 'helpfully' tagged for me, but I'm getting real tired of you ducking me man. Peace out.   \n",

If you were to watch an older Ukrainian or Moldovan or Bulgarian movie, you'd think the background music is Klezmer... Incidentally, like with so many other things Jewish - The Israeli national anthem isn't \"\"Jewish\"\" at all, but an old Italian song, if I'm not mistaken, with Hebrew lyrics. Btw, Hebrew is an artificially revived language. Up until last century it was like Latin - a dead language, used only in religion (which needs to die too). And then it was artificially resuscitated by Zionists. Which is funny, because the founders of teh modern state of Israel were atheists, it's a shame what they have done, giving a bad name to all atheists. \"   \n",

Haha. it is great that you have noticed that no, in fact, tito is nobody and nothing but a DEMocidal totalitarian communist dictator.

He was a a puppet in regards to geopolitical relations between the east and west during the cold war years - his legacy and his psychopathic bloodthirsty trail ended with his sick national experiment which will never return ever.

They make wikipedia a better place, regardless of source (and for the record I think that ALL of my images qualify as fair use). you are actually working against everything that is good about wikipedia, systematically going after people and questioning everything they do. Who told you to do this? Why take the 'law' into your own hands? Ask yourself this: who are you protecting? You want to play cops and robbers, go and joing the freaking police. Do something useful, rather than wasting your life on here. What is your job? Cos this are not real life buddy, and if its your only hobby, I feel bad for you. I mean really bad. I thinks it is quite sad that your only reason for using wikipedia is to actively reverse what other people do, rather than to actively create content.

Incidentally, like with so many other things Jewish - The Israeli national anthem is not \"\"Jewish\"\" at all, but an old Italian song, if I am not mistaken, with Hebrew lyrics. [Btw; by the way], Hebrew is an artificially revived language. Up until last century it was like Latin - a dead language, used only in religion (which needs to die too). And then it was artificially resuscitated by Zionists. Which is funny, because the founders of teh modern state of Israel were atheists, it is a shame what they have done, giving a bad name to all atheists. \"   \n",

They are the only pages where factual informaiton is being left out. Cathel, you cannot deny that One Night In Hacknkey is targeting Irish Republican Catholics. You don't see him removing Jewish categories from any other pages, and there are many people in Jewish categories who are not notable for being Jewish. So then why does this rule only apply to Irish Republican Catholics? And of course, the church will condemn any form of violence. Mainstream Muslims leaders also condemn terrorism, does not mean Islamic terrorists should not be in Muslim categories? By your logic, yes.

They are the only pages where factual informaiton is being left out. Cathel, you cannot deny that One Night In Hacknkey is targeting Irish Republican Catholics. You don't see him removing Jewish categories from any other pages, and there are many people in Jewish categories who are not notable for being Jewish. So then why does this rule only apply to Irish Republican Catholics? And of course, the church will condemn any form of violence. Mainstream Muslims leaders also condemn terrorism, does not mean Islamic terrorists should not be in Muslim categories? By your logic, yes. So if I start removing terrorists from Muslim categories, I can count on you to back me up when a person readds the categories?   \n",

OK, how 'bout this: the original comment I made about Everlast's entry constantly being vandalized by Eminem fans was written a month ago before your dumb ass got involved with the site. The feud started with the Dilated Peoples track. That's why I believed that the verse Everlast contributed should be in there (and still do). The jabs taken back and forth after that deserve a synopsis only. Your idiotic little comment about album sales was excessive and unnecessary. It belongs in there no more than the fact that everyone who knows both artists agrees that if they ever got into it, Everlast would knock the living shit outta Eminem. And THAT came off an Eminem fan site.   \n",

They are the only pages where factual informaiton is being left out. Cathel, you cannot deny that One Night In Hacknkey is targeting Irish Republican Catholics. You do not see him removing Jewish categories from any other pages, and there are many people in Jewish categories who are notable for being Jewish. So then why does this rule only apply to Irish Republican Catholics? And of course, the church will condemn any form of violence. Mainstream Muslims leaders also condemn terrorism, does not mean Islamic terrorists should not be in Muslim categories? By your logic, yes. So if I start removing terrorists from Muslim categories, I can count on you to back me up when a person readds the categories?   \n",

OK, how 'bout this: the original comment I made about Everlast's entry constantly being vandalized by Eminem fans was written a month ago before your dumb ass got involved with the site. The feud started with the Dilated Peoples track. that is why I believed that the verse Everlast contributed should be in there (and still do). The jabs taken back and forth after that deserve a synopsis only. Your idiotic little comment about album sales was excessive and unnecessary. It belongs in there no more than the fact that everyone who knows both artists agrees that if they ever got into it, Everlast would knock the living shit outta Eminem. And THAT came off an Eminem fan site.   \n",
