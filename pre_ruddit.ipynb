A cost is a cost, it doesn't matter if it's up front or spread out, doesn't make a huge difference. In fact, it's easier for most people/organizations to pay a cost spread out over than all up front. Regardless, gun ownership does have a recurring cost in license renewal. \\n\\nThe analogy doesn't need to be 100% the same, I see no significant differences. \\n\\nAnother analogy that might suit you better is that in order to assemble in protest you need a permit, and in many places that comes with a non-refundable application fee. Here is an example of the government actively putting a paywall in-front of exercising a first amendment right.   \n",

       "1490  I heard plenty of women say bigger dick is better. More than Ive heard the opposite and in situations where I would believe them more than the ones that say it isnt that big of a deal. Ive heard women say things like they cant even feel it with some men that have a small penis. That kind of thing. \\n\\nIm sure it wouldnt take me very long to find instances of this around the web. But ive heard it in person and around the web, in the media. And no, Im not just talking about porn. \\n\\nim not saying that women prefer huge dick. Im saying that most women would prefer 6inches compared to 4inches because it feels better. Saying otherwise is being nice/dishonest.\\n\\nIm honestly surprised you havent come across these sort of opinions, because my experience is a bit different.   \n",

The MSR7 don't isolate that well in loud environments. The 1A would be better from that perspective, comfort, and provides more bass. The Oppo PM3 and NAD VISIO HP50 are both good isolators, but I just saw your comment about how overpriced they are, plus the PM3 wouldn't have enough bass if you're worried about bass on the MSR7. I've had a lot of portables and I think the 1A may be best for you, especially considering reasonable Japan prices.

A cost is a cost, it doesn't matter if it's up front or spread out, doesn't make a huge difference. In fact, it's easier for most people/organizations to pay a cost spread out over than all up front. Regardless, gun ownership does have a recurring cost in license renewal. The analogy doesn't need to be 100% the same, I see no significant differences. Another analogy that might suit you better is that in order to assemble in protest you need a permit, and in many places that comes with a non-refundable application fee. Here is an example of the government actively putting a paywall in-front of exercising a first amendment right.   \n",

       "1490  I heard plenty of women say bigger dick is better. More than Ive heard the opposite and in situations where I would believe them more than the ones that say it isnt that big of a deal. Ive heard women say things like they cant even feel it with some men that have a small penis. That kind of thing. Im sure it wouldnt take me very long to find instances of this around the web. But ive heard it in person and around the web, in the media. And no, Im not just talking about porn. im not saying that women prefer huge dick. Im saying that most women would prefer 6inches compared to 4inches because it feels better. Saying otherwise is being nice/dishonest. Im honestly surprised you havent come across these sort of opinions, because my experience is a bit different.   \n",

The MSR7 do not isolate that well in loud environments. The 1A would better from that perspective, comfort, and provides more bass. The Oppo PM3 and NAD VISIO HP50 are both good isolators, but I just saw your comment about how overpriced they are, plus the PM3 would not have enough bass if you are worried about bass on the MSR7. I have had a lot of portables and I think the 1A may best for you, especially considering reasonable Japan prices. The Momentums are really laid back up top, the m50x are more v-shaped that the 1A.   \n",

A cost is a cost, it does not matter if it is up front or spread out, does not make a huge difference. In fact, it is easier for most people/organizations to pay a cost spread out over than all up front. Regardless, gun ownership does have a recurring cost in license renewal. The analogy does not need to be 100% the same, I see no significant differences. Another analogy that might suit you better is that in order to assemble in protest you need a permit, and in many places that comes with a non-refundable application fee. Here is an example of the government actively putting a paywall in-front of exercising a first amendment right.   \n",

Ive heard women say things like they cant even feel it with some men that have a small penis. That kind of thing. Im sure it wouldnt take me very long to find instances of this around the web. But ive heard it in person and around the web, in the media. And no, Im not just talking about [pornography]. im not saying that women prefer huge dick. Im saying that most women would prefer 6inches compared to 4inches because it feels better. Saying otherwise is being nice/dishonest.

Sometimes you are emotionally happy with the person you're with, but they are not interested or willing to provide the level of sexual satisfaction that they used to. Plus there are families to consider. Breaking up a family AKA divorce is difficult on children.   \n",

Rape laws are another example where some states define rape purely in terms of penetration such that sometimes only people with vaginas can be raped, sometimes only people with penises can commit rape, etc. based on the wording of the law. States are slowly changing them, but none of the old laws that define it on anatomy have been struck down by the courts, AFAIK.   \n",

If he isn't happy with the situation don't get married, or if already married get divorced. She doesn't have to, but I believe that would be the more healthy thing to do for the relationship.

Maybe in your country, but the U.S. courts have not struck down all laws that differentiate men and women by anatomy. Rape laws are another example where some states define rape purely in terms of penetration such that sometimes only people with vaginas can be raped, sometimes only people with penises can commit rape, etc. based on the wording of the law. States are slowly changing them, but none of the old laws that define it on anatomy have been struck down by the courts, AFAIK.   \n",

Most married men I interact with. > Does she have to perform the finding or can she just allow it and let him do his thing? > Why cannot the man be responsible for determining what he accepts in a relationship? If he is not happy with the situation do not get married, or if already married get divorced. She does not have to, but I believe that would be the more healthy thing to do for the relationship. Sometimes you are emotionally happy with the person you are with, but they are not interested or willing to provide the level of sexual satisfaction that they used to. Plus there are families to consider. Breaking up a family [also known as] divorce is difficult on children.   \n",

Maybe in your country, but the U.S. courts have not struck down all laws that differentiate men and women by anatomy. Rape laws are another example where some states define rape purely in terms of penetration such that sometimes only people with vaginas can be raped, sometimes only people with penises can commit rape, etc. based on the wording of the law. States are slowly changing them, but none of the old laws that define it on anatomy have been struck down by the courts, [as far as i know].   \n",

       "566   It’s definitely partly the cause, but the cause affects how the kneeling is interpreted. Kneeling for veterans seems like an additional show of respect for our country and those who have served; kneeling for BLM-inspired protest of perceived injustice to African Americans at the hands of police feels to people like a statement that (1) lumps all police officers together as bad, (2) divides black vs white, (3) exaggerates a problem that is actually affecting all races, and (4) judges our country as a place not worthy of respect because it is seriously impeding the black race in 2018. Add to that that the controversial, predictably triggering action is being done at work before a game meant to entertain. \\n\\nFor those who interpret it that way, including some black people, it seems like the wrong time and place, as well as too easily misinterpreted.\\n\\n   \n",

Can you elaborate on that? I was never a Scout and I don't know any, that I know of anyway.

       "566   It's definitely partly the cause, but the cause affects how the kneeling is interpreted. Kneeling for veterans seems like an additional show of respect for our country and those who have served; kneeling for BLM-inspired protest of perceived injustice to African Americans at the hands of police feels to people like a statement that (1) lumps all police officers together as bad, (2) divides black vs white, (3) exaggerates a problem that is actually affecting all races, and (4) judges our country as a place not worthy of respect because it is seriously impeding the black race in 2018. Add to that that the controversial, predictably triggering action is being done at work before a game meant to entertain. For those who interpret it that way, including some black people, it seems like the wrong time and place, as well as too easily misinterpreted.   \n",

       "566   it is definitely partly the cause, but the cause affects how the kneeling is interpreted. Kneeling for veterans seems like an additional show of respect for our country and those who have served; kneeling for BLM-inspired protest of perceived injustice to African Americans at the hands of police feels to people like a statement that (1) lumps all police officers together as bad, (2) divides black vs white, (3) exaggerates a problem that is actually affecting all races, and (4) judges our country as a place not worthy of respect because it is seriously impeding the black race in 2018. Add to that the controversial, predictably triggering action is being done at work before a game meant to entertain. For those who interpret it that way, including some black people, it seems like the wrong time and place, as well as too easily misinterpreted.   \n",
