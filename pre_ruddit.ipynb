'Franny & Zooey' and 'Raise High the Roofbeam, Carpenters' are both outstanding in my opinion. (As an addendum: I also still definitely appreciate Catcher for what it is, and I am glad I read it when I did. it is very well written and there is not really anything else quite like it, and it introduced me to a great author. So I will always have a special place in my heart for that book.)  \n",
