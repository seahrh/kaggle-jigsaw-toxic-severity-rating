Linux tends to have some very pedantic people. I think some just like to \"validate\" their own intelligence by correcting the most trivial of things. Anyway, it is a milestone and you are well on your way. You'll find things are just \"different\" but when re-learning how to be an advanced user, you'll find it is much more rewarding, in my opinion.   \n",

Mass migration/Globalism is NOT the answer for long term stability. You can't manage HATE. You make laws and build protection against HATE. IE. fences around the elementary school playground. A small group of people in control of Earth is not the answer.

Then certainly it will keep it's status. \\n\\nBut as it stands now the ball is in Chinas court, and it is taking advantage while it can.

If the USA can turn itself around and get voters out there to actually vote, and start some major economic reforms in the next election. Then certainly it will keep it's status. But as it stands now the ball is in Chinas court, and it is taking advantage while it can. So for now it's definitely a wait and see, and the next presidential election will be critical   \n",

       "1427  No one is going to want to be the person who makes that sacrifice if the relationship ending means their life is ruined. Who specifically calls it quits first doesn't really matter, does it? Imagine a woman, who, under your scenario, realizes the relationship isn't working, and, instead of filing for divorce and losing everything the couple has earned, just starts treating the man poorly, ruining every moment they are together until *he* files for divorce. The fact that matters is that the relationship ended, and the two people should share in the things the relationship invested in, and the earning potential of both people is part of that. Let's skip the 'who quit first' thing, and just focus on fairly dividing up the couples assets.   \n",

If the USA can turn itself around and get voters out there to actually vote, and start some major economic reforms in the next election. Then certainly it will keep it is status. But as it stands now the ball is in Chinas court, and it is taking advantage while it can. So for now it is definitely a wait and see, and the next presidential election will be critical  \n",

       "1427  No one is going to want to be the person who makes that sacrifice if the relationship ending means their life is ruined. Who specifically calls it quits first does not really matter, does it? Imagine a woman, who, under your scenario, realizes the relationship is not working, and, instead of filing for divorce and losing everything the couple has earned, just starts treating the man poorly, ruining every moment they are together until *he* files for divorce. The fact that matters is that the relationship ended, and the two people should share in the things the relationship invested in, and the earning potential of both people is part of that. let us skip the 'who quit first' thing, and just focus on fairly dividing up the couples assets.  \n",
