       "2705  Arizona wasn't bad then, they've just been completely decimated by injuries since. Arizona freshman RB JJ Taylor was an absolute beast before he was lost for the season. Not to mention that they lost so many QBs to injury (Solomon, Dawkins, Tate, and Werlinger sucks) that they ended up playing a TE at QB for part of a game (Matt Morin). Then they lost pretty much everyone who has ever lined up at RB, to the point they started WR Samajie Grant at RB. You're probably safer playing with your toaster in the shower than behind the line for Arizona.\\n\\nAnyway, point being, I think if Arizona was at full-strength, they wouldn't be the Pac-12 cellar-dweller they are now. JJ Taylor was scary.   \n",

Having an older person be into you makes you feel awesome and loved. Yeah, they're not the same as the others your age. But you're probably in totally different stages of your lives, and there will likely be an unseen, but subconscious power imbalance that will manifest as the years go by. \\n\\nThe younger you are and the bigger the gap, the more extreme these issues could become. Also, it might be illegal depending on where you live. That's important to keep in mind as well.   \n",

Either you can reinvent it , travel or go part time at work. Either way selling and investing it in market would be great . Sell and and wait couple years for recession/ market crash. You'll get great value of stocks and a higher dividend. Enjoy early retirement if that's what your looking for !   \n",

Winning is about team performance. If your team isn't good you will still lose more than you win even if you are one of the most skilled players. You can be an insane player and lose. Winning isn't an issue but it still means you are very likely to die less, have less ecos where yout chances of fragging are low, get more eco kills etc. Having good stats in a game you win, often even very clearly, is going to be a lot easier than when you are losing.   \n",

       "2705  Arizona wasn't bad then, they've just been completely decimated by injuries since. Arizona freshman RB JJ Taylor was an absolute beast before he was lost for the season. Not to mention that they lost so many QBs to injury (Solomon, Dawkins, Tate, and Werlinger sucks) that they ended up playing a TE at QB for part of a game (Matt Morin). Then they lost pretty much everyone who has ever lined up at RB, to the point they started WR Samajie Grant at RB. You're probably safer playing with your toaster in the shower than behind the line for Arizona. Anyway, point being, I think if Arizona was at full-strength, they wouldn't be the Pac-12 cellar-dweller they are now. JJ Taylor was scary.   \n",

I know. Having an older person be into you makes you feel awesome and loved. Yeah, they're not the same as the others your age. But you're probably in totally different stages of your lives, and there will likely be an unseen, but subconscious power imbalance that will manifest as the years go by. The younger you are and the bigger the gap, the more extreme these issues could become. Also, it might be illegal depending on where you live. That's important to keep in mind as well.   \n",

Either you can reinvent it , travel or go part time at work. Either way selling and investing it in market would be great . Sell and and wait couple years for recession/ market crash. you will get great value of stocks and a higher dividend. Enjoy early retirement if that is what your looking for !  \n",

Winning is about team performance. If your team is not good you will still lose more than you win even if you are one of the most skilled players. You can be an insane player and lose. Winning is not an issue but it still means you are very likely to die less, have less ecos where yout chances of fragging are low, get more eco kills etc. Having good stats in a game you win, often even very clearly, is going to be a lot easier than when you are losing.  \n",

Do you choose the desire to eat such foods? Do you choose the knowledge you have to combat these desires? Do you choose the desire to get up and go to the gym? Nothing is a choice. Sometimes you get provoked into doing one thing or another. What we need to do is set up an incentive system prodding people into happy, healthy lives.  \n",

       "2705  Arizona was not bad then, they have just been completely decimated by injuries since. Arizona freshman RB JJ Taylor was an absolute beast before he was lost for the season. Not to mention that they lost so many QBs to injury (Solomon, Dawkins, Tate, and Werlinger [be very bad or unpleasant]) that they ended up playing a TE at QB for part of a game (Matt Morin). Then they lost pretty much everyone who has ever lined up at RB, to the point they started WR Samajie Grant at RB. you are probably safer playing with your toaster in the shower than behind the line for Arizona. Anyway, point being, I think if Arizona was at full-strength, they would not be the Pac-12 cellar-dweller they are now. JJ Taylor was scary.  \n",

I know. Having an older person be into you makes you feel awesome and loved. Yeah, they are not the same as the others your age. But you are probably in totally different stages of your lives, and there will likely be an unseen, but subconscious power imbalance that will manifest as the years go by. The younger you are and the bigger the gap, the more extreme these issues could become. Also, it might be illegal depending on where you live. that is important to keep in mind as well.  \n",

The cities are eager to keep them around for the tourist exposure as well as the pride/bragging rights (if there's an overall net gain or not, I'd be curious for links to some studies).\\n\\nConceptually, I totally agree, especially when it's at the expense of public parks, but sadly it won't mean anything unless everyone agrees not to give incentives.   \n",

       "1910  It took a long time but I finally learned at age 19 or 20: **women love veiny arms**\\n\\nI don't mean skinny arms with spider-veins, but muscles on forearms with the one or two enlarged veins up the length. It gets women rock hard. I've been working in manufacturing for several years and I'm getting to the muscle structure of a 26 year-old going on 35, because I work with heavy materials and tools 6 days of the week. I've noticed lately, that when I wear muscle shirts or just roll up my sleeves, I catch the eyes of one of my female co-workers and it gives me a huge confidence boost.\\n\\nOne day, I asked one of them about it and she confirmed: women really love the prominent vein on a man's forearm.

The cities are eager to keep them around for the tourist exposure as well as the pride/bragging rights (if there's an overall net gain or not, I'd be curious for links to some studies). Conceptually, I totally agree, especially when it's at the expense of public parks, but sadly it won't mean anything unless everyone agrees not to give incentives.   \n",

       "1910  It took a long time but I finally learned at age 19 or 20: **women love veiny arms** I don't mean skinny arms with spider-veins, but muscles on forearms with the one or two enlarged veins up the length. It gets women rock hard. I've been working in manufacturing for several years and I'm getting to the muscle structure of a 26 year-old going on 35, because I work with heavy materials and tools 6 days of the week. I've noticed lately, that when I wear muscle shirts or just roll up my sleeves, I catch the eyes of one of my female co-workers and it gives me a huge confidence boost. One day, I asked one of them about it and she confirmed: women really love the prominent vein on a man's forearm. There's even a subreddit for it.   \n",

Some people may say they are who they are because of it and are thankful for that's fine, but remember that it's a spectrum and can be horrible. I don't think any normal parent would want their child to have autism, so what the anti-vaxxer is saying makes sense other than the part about vaccines causing autism. The point I'm trying to make is that the person might not be acting like autism is monstrous, but rather that it is often a negative experience for the one with autism. I am not an expert on autism nor do I have it (as far as I know) so please correct me if I'm wrong about something. Antivaxxers still suck.   \n",

The cities are eager to keep them around for the tourist exposure as well as the pride/bragging rights (if there is an overall net gain or not, I would be curious for links to some studies). Conceptually, I totally agree, especially when it is at the expense of public parks, but sadly it will not mean anything unless everyone agrees not to give incentives.  \n",

       "1910  It took a long time but I finally learned at age 19 or 20: **women love veiny arms** I do not mean skinny arms with spider-veins, but muscles on forearms with the one or two enlarged veins up the length. It gets women rock hard. I have been working in manufacturing for several years and I am getting to the muscle structure of a 26 year-old going on 35, because I work with heavy materials and tools 6 days of the week. I have noticed lately, that when I wear muscle shirts or just roll up my sleeves, I catch the eyes of one of my female co-workers and it gives me a huge confidence boost. One day, I asked one of them about it and she confirmed: women really love the prominent vein on a man's forearm. There is even a subreddit for it.  \n",

Some people may say they are who they are because of it and are thankful for that is fine, but remember that it is a spectrum and can be horrible. I do not think any normal parent would want their child to have autism, so what the anti-vaxxer is saying makes sense other than the part about vaccines causing autism. The point I am trying to make is that the person might not be acting like autism is monstrous, but rather that it is often a negative experience for the one with autism. I am not an expert on autism nor do I have it (as far as I know) so please correct me if I am wrong about something. Antivaxxers still suck.  \n",
