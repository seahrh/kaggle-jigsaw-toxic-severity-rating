Therefore, it makes it even easier to gain weight after losing the weight from before (childhood in my case). So for people like me, who do work hard even just to maintain my weight after losing some, the question is... was it a choice for me as a kid to create all those new fat cells. Because I’m stuck with them now... they just lay there waiting to be inflated by any calorie I eat and don’t burn. It sucks man it’s a lot harder than people think.    \n",

Therefore, it makes it even easier to gain weight after losing the weight from before (childhood in my case). So for people like me, who do work hard even just to maintain my weight after losing some, the question is... was it a choice for me as a kid to create all those new fat cells. Because I'm stuck with them now... they just lay there waiting to be inflated by any calorie I eat and don't burn. It sucks man it's a lot harder than people think.   \n",

The story is about Germany, I live in Denmark and we have a problem with objectively false stories being spread as the truth and people getting up in arms about it.\\n\\nYou talk about deciding what is real news and that nobody should be able to tell the media what they can publish and what they cannot. Of cause you are right, that would be government censorship and nobody wants to do that.\\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between letting someone in power decide which opinion you can and which opinions you cannot publish, and punishing publishing what is objectively false information.\\n\\nThis is the same as if a news agency writes a false story about you, that would be defamation and that is illegal both here and I believe in the US.   \n",

Yeah, ideally, we would want the donation to come from a sincere place, but in the end, what difference does it make if a charity receives $1,000,000 from an anonymous donor or if they receive $1,000,000 from someone who hopes to share that information?

       "5310  Did you read what I wrote? The story is about Germany, I live in Denmark and we have a problem with objectively false stories being spread as the truth and people getting up in arms about it. You talk about deciding what is real news and that nobody should be able to tell the media what they can publish and what they cannot. Of cause you are right, that would be government censorship and nobody wants to do that. But there is a huge difference between letting someone in power decide which opinion you can and which opinions you cannot publish, and punishing publishing what is objectively false information. This is the same as if a news agency writes a false story about you, that would be defamation and that is illegal both here and I believe in the US.   \n",

Yeah, ideally, we would want the donation to come from a sincere place, but in the end, what difference does it make if a charity receives $1,000,000 from anonymous donor if they receive $1,000,000 from someone who hopes to share that information?

       "5310  Did you read what I wrote? The story is about Germany, I live in Denmark and we have a problem with objectively false stories being spread as the truth and people getting up in arms about it. You talk about deciding what is real news and that nobody should be able to tell the media what they can publish and what they cannot. Of cause you are right, that would be government censorship and nobody wants to do that. But there is a huge difference between letting someone in power decide which opinion you can and which opinions you cannot publish, and punishing publishing what is objectively false information. This the same as if a news agency writes a false story about you, that would be defamation and that is illegal both here and I believe in the US.   \n",
