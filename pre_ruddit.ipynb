When you don't expect giant plot shifts at the end of each chapter like in Swords it lets you really appreciate the ballsyness of Martin to add in a bunch of characters and a bunch of slow burning plots right after his greatest triumph as a writer. That and the best moments of the last two books like The North Remembers (I got chills just writing that), Fire and Blood, and the the entirety of Jaime's arc in Feast are some of the best moments in the entire series.   \n",

       "1067  I'm a non drinker by choice and all my near/dear ones are drinker. I don't drink b'cos I don't really like the taste (which i know lot of ppl don't like , but still drink) and secondly, I don't like the fact that i will do something to my self to lose my awareness even by a fraction. I used to fall in trap for request for drinking, and then i realized, while i don't enjoy the drink, everyone else is having their fun.To be part of of the fun, i should drink something i like, which in most cases ends up being water or juice. Now a days, i give a stare when my close relatives /friends pushes me for a drink and they give up. Drinking is not for me. And everyone deserves to be happy in their own way.   \n",

When you don't expect giant plot shifts at the end of each chapter like in Swords it lets you really appreciate the ballsyness of Martin to add in a bunch of characters and a bunch of slow burning plots right after his greatest triumph as a writer. That and the best moments of the last two books like The North Remembers (I got chills just writing that), Fire and Blood, and the the entirety of Jaime's arc in Feast are some of the best moments in the entire series.   \n",

       "1067  I am a non drinker by choice and all my near/dear ones are drinker. I do not drink b'cos I do not really like the taste (which i know lot of [people] do not like , but still drink) and secondly, I do not like the fact that i will do something to my self to lose my awareness even by a fraction. I used to fall in trap for request for drinking, and then i realized, while i do not enjoy the drink, everyone else is having their fun.To be part of of the fun, i should drink something i like, which in most cases ends up being water or juice. Now a days, i give a stare when my close relatives /friends pushes me for a drink and they give up. Drinking is not for me. And everyone deserves to be happy in their own way.  \n",

When you do not expect giant plot shifts at the end of each chapter like in Swords it lets you really appreciate the ballsyness of Martin to add in a bunch of characters and a bunch of slow burning plots right after his greatest triumph as a writer. That and the best moments of the last two books like The North Remembers (I got chills just writing that), Fire and Blood, and the the entirety of Jaime's arc in Feast are some of the best moments in the entire series.  \n",

       "899   Whipped cream is so much more versatile when it comes to flavoring.  If you make it yourself you can add: coffee syrup, bourbon, maple syrup, orange zest, vanilla, dark rum, smore shnops, or whatever flavors you want to add.  With marshmallows you get marshmallow flavor and that's it.  \\n\\nRegardless, of the arguments presented here, including mine, I'm going to challenge your premise that there is a best hot chocolate topper that works for everyone.  That's a bullshit premise.  It's your hot chocolate, put whatever the hell you want into it, and let other people have their hot chocolate however they want it.

I do not justify anyone making death threats on anyone.  Why is it liberal cities have the highest crime rates in the US?  Why are liberals calling for peoples heads in DC tonight?  Why will the next mass shooting in our country, just as the last, be committed by someone with liberal ideals.  Liberalism is a disease that manifests itself in those who think they are better than anyone, yet believe they are owed something from society.   \n",

       "899   Whipped cream is so much more versatile when it comes to flavoring. If you make it yourself you can add: coffee syrup, bourbon, maple syrup, orange zest, vanilla, dark rum, smore shnops, or whatever flavors you want to add. With marshmallows you get marshmallow flavor and that's it. Regardless, of the arguments presented here, including mine, I'm going to challenge your premise that there is a best hot chocolate topper that works for everyone. That's a bullshit premise. It's your hot chocolate, put whatever the hell you want into it, and let other people have their hot chocolate however they want it. To each their own, but don't be afraid to try out someone else's way just in case they're on to something.   \n",

       "899   Whipped cream is so much more versatile when it comes to flavoring. If you make it yourself you can add: coffee syrup, bourbon, maple syrup, orange zest, vanilla, dark rum, smore shnops, or whatever flavors you want to add. With marshmallows you get marshmallow flavor and that is it. Regardless, of the arguments presented here, including mine, I am going to challenge your premise that there is a best hot chocolate topper that works for everyone. that is a bullshit premise. it is your hot chocolate, put whatever the hell you want into it, and let other people have their hot chocolate however they want it. To each their own, but do not be afraid to try out someone else's way just in case they are on to something.  \n",

       "27    There is a culture of exclusion in many higher paying fields like tech and science wherein women don't feel like they belong, are equals, etc. to men. And so some elect to enter another field after experiencing this directly, whereas others opt never to enter such fields in the first place and take up lesser paying jobs. \\n\\nSociological forces are at play, is my point. Also, the burden of children is something you shouldn't neglect. There are all sorts of reasons why a child came unplanned into her life, something which had a detrimental impact on her potential job earnings. And if you count the total number of caloric hours of labor undertaken by men and women, women work between 20 to 30 percent more per week than men, on average. Because, yes, child care and home making is labor, albeit unpaid.    \n",

       "27    There is a culture of exclusion in many higher paying fields like tech and science wherein women don't feel like they belong, are equals, etc. to men. And so some elect to enter another field after experiencing this directly, whereas others opt never to enter such fields in the first place and take up lesser paying jobs. Sociological forces are at play, is my point. Also, the burden of children is something you shouldn't neglect. There are all sorts of reasons why a child came unplanned into her life, something which had a detrimental impact on her potential job earnings. And if you count the total number of caloric hours of labor undertaken by men and women, women work between 20 to 30 percent more per week than men, on average. Because, yes, child care and home making is labor, albeit unpaid.   \n",

       "27    There is a culture of exclusion in many higher paying fields like tech and science wherein women do not feel like they belong, are equals, etc. to men. And so some elect to enter another field after experiencing this directly, whereas others opt never to enter such fields in the first place and take up lesser paying jobs. Sociological forces are at play, is my point. Also, the burden of children is something you should not neglect. There are all sorts of reasons why a child came unplanned into her life, something which had a detrimental impact on her potential job earnings. And if you count the total number of caloric hours of labor undertaken by men and women, women work between 20 to 30 percent more per week than men, on average. Because, yes, child care and home making is labor, albeit unpaid.  \n",
