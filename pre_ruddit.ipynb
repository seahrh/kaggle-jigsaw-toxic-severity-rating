Wahington *potentially* gets punished for [call for help during an emergency]. Probably will not matter if they win the PAC-12 while undefeated or with one loss. I do not think they will be left out of the top 4, though. Strong emphasis on [call for help during an emergency] could put Clemson as high as 1. Emphasis on the eye test could put as low as 4, but I doubt we will be lower than 3.</td>\n",

It'd be a shame if... the committee decided to... stir up some controversy (probably not happening, but one can hope). Wahington *potentially* gets punished for SOS. Probably won't matter if they win the PAC-12 while undefeated or with one loss. I don't think they'll be left out of the top 4, though. Strong emphasis on SOS could put Clemson as high as 1. Emphasis on the eye test could put as low as 4, but I doubt we'll be lower than 3.   \n",

I am sure this will melt your girl right off of her feet. A hard-day's work is worth it if she sees you being sweet to her.

       "2718  Louisville does not get much love because of [call for help during an emergency]. Could potentially see them as low as 6 maybe even lower depending on how cruel they are. First time Bama in the top 4 is a no-brainer. it would be a shame if... the committee decided to... stir up some controversy (probably not happening, but one can hope). Wahington *potentially* gets punished for [call for help during an emergency]. Probably will not matter if they win the PAC-12 while undefeated or with one loss. I do not think they will be left out of the top 4, though. Strong emphasis on [call for help during an emergency] could put Clemson as high as 1. Emphasis on the eye test could put as low as 4, but I doubt we will be lower than 3.  \n",

       "386   The central idea is that the power to tax is the power to destroy.  Theoretically, if the government wanted to destroy a disfavored religion (or it decided that all religions were disfavored), it could contrive a reason to impose really burdensome taxes on it to the point where it can no longer function (priests need to eat, and churches need to keep the lights on).  This, of course, would violate the free exercise and establishment clauses of the First Amendment.  So the government has decided, in an abundance of caution, to just not tax any religion for any purpose in the interest of maintaining the separation between church and state and honoring the First Amendment.   \n",

In fact, it is anti-microbial. * Salt is dense and uses space efficiently. * Salt is cheap and widely available. * Salt can be used for many other things such as making icy roads safer to drive on, food preservation, etc.   \n",
       "386   The central idea is that the power to tax is the power to destroy. Theoretically, if the government wanted to destroy a disfavored religion (or it decided that all religions were disfavored), it could contrive a reason to impose really burdensome taxes on it to the point where it can no longer function (priests need to eat, and churches need to keep the lights on). This, of course, would violate the free exercise and establishment clauses of the First Amendment. So the government has decided, in an abundance of caution, to just not tax any religion for any purpose in the interest of maintaining the separation between church and state and honoring the First Amendment.   \n",

I don't think Trump was perceived as a threat, really. He was lampooned even as he was hours away from winning the election. I think a lot of people didn't seriously believe so many millions of Americans were willing to vote for such a candidate. That so many regret their vote now doesn't change the fact that the party's decades-long effort to destroy public education and dismantle the fourth estate with propaganda has been extremely effective.   \n",

       "386   The central idea is that the power to tax is the power to destroy. Theoretically, if the government wanted to destroy a disfavored religion (or it decided that all religions were disfavored), it could contrive a reason to impose really burdensome taxes on it to the point where it can no longer function (priests need to eat, and churches need to keep the lights on). This, of course, would violate the free exercise and establishment clauses of the First Amendment. So the government has decided, in abundance of caution, to just not tax any religion for any purpose in the interest of maintaining the separation between church and state and honoring the First Amendment.  \n",

Guys usually think that when a girl is smiling or looking at them is because she wants to smash. It's worse when the guys are in their early 20s.  Which kinda makes a lot of friendships uncomfortable for a lot of girls because sooner or later, there's a lot of guy friends that are gonna try to smash, especially if the dude's been having a dry spell.   \n",

       "4946  > Hamas will never stop blowing themselves up until every Jew is a burned, smoking corpse\\n\\nHamas has (by and large) accepted the international consensus for peace. A two state solution based on the 1967 borders. Israel refuses this international consensus. Israel is the one that doesn't want peace. Israel is the one that most regularly breaks the cease-fires. Israel is almost always the aggressor. \\n\\n> We should just nuke the entire area and make it uninhabitable for everyone. Neither culture is important or with saving. \\n\\nOr you know, we support the 195 nation solution to a settlement. Peace is really easy if the US and Israel want it.
