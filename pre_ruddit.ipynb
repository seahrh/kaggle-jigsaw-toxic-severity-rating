       "1149                                              Let’s try this another way. There is a clearly marked men’s room and women’s room (single occupancy). There are 4 men  and three women in the respective lines (with the understanding that more people will add to the line within the next few minutes because that’s how bladders work). Are you saying you think it would be smooth sailing if you were to get into the shorter [women’s] line? Obviously you will get some funny looks at a minimum and even though it’s single-occupancy, I will wager that your presence will make the women uncomfortable.\\n\\nAm I wrong? Am I misunderstanding your argument?   \n",

I really hate that this movement has made all gay people look so much worse. All of my \"queer\" friends are entirely average people who do not take part in any of the crazier fashion things they apparently should. One of them has color in her hair, but she is vocally anti-SJW. I really do not think these SJW gay people actually understand their so-called \"community.\" They most definitely do not represent gay people. SJWs are outcasts for entirely different reasons.

       "1227  Obesity is essentially an addiction to food.  The obese get a greater dopamine kick from eating than the average person which makes it extremely difficult for them to eat within a healthy range.  But here's the real trouble: unlike every other addiction, there is ZERO possibility of abstinence - the only way to truly end an addiction.  Imagine a heroin addict who needs to give himself a tiny dose of heroin every day to stay alive.  Like all addictions, it's partly moral choice, but there is a massive unchosen biological component they can't do a thing about.      \n",

       "1227  Obesity is essentially an addiction to food. The obese get a greater dopamine kick from eating than the average person which makes it extremely difficult for them to eat within a healthy range. But here's the real trouble: unlike every other addiction, there is ZERO possibility of abstinence - the only way to truly end an addiction. Imagine a heroin addict who needs to give himself a tiny dose of heroin every day to stay alive. Like all addictions, it's partly moral choice, but there is a massive unchosen biological component they can't do a thing about.   \n",

       "1227  Obesity is essentially an addiction to food. The obese get a greater dopamine kick from eating than the average person which makes it extremely difficult for them to eat within a healthy range. But here is the real trouble: unlike every other addiction, there is ZERO possibility of abstinence - the only way to truly end an addiction. Imagine a heroin addict who needs to give himself a tiny dose of heroin every day to stay alive. Like all addictions, it is partly moral choice, but there is a massive unchosen biological component they cannot do a thing about.  \n",

       "3907  Someone needs to tell these people their own history. There was a very long history of women working outside the home, especially during the Islamic Golden Age. I really think the best way to fight back against this would be to point out that Muhammad's (PBUH) wife Khadija was a merchant who worked outside the home, namely on trade routes going to Syria and Yemen, which, considering she was based in Mecca are really long distances, especially back then. They are not going to be able to come up with an explanation that is not complete Bullcrap. This stuff among Muslims needs to stop.

I really think the best way to fight back against this would be to point out that Muhammad's (PBUH) wife Khadija was a merchant who worked outside the home, namely on trade routes going to Syria and Yemen, which, considering she was based in Mecca are really long distances, especially back then. They are not going to be able to come up with an explanation that is not complete Bullcrap. This stuff among Muslims needs to stop.
